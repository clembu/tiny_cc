# Skill

## Ranged_wpn

This skill allows to use all kinds of **ranged weapons**, real or dreamt.
It also allows for **maintenance** and **repair**
(might need materials or tools.)

All ranged weapons follow the same **ammunitions management** rule:
on every shot attempt, the player must first
succeed an
**ammunition roll**
(detailed in each weapon's description) by rolling
for a lower total than the weapon's value.
This system bundles under a single roll
things like weapon fiability, ammunition reliability,
and the possibility to run out of ammo.
A failed roll means an empty magazine or a jammed weapon,
which could be re-engaged with a new
[Skill](Ranged_wpn)
roll and may need some tools.

---

Automatic weapons are handled with the [Skill](War_machine) skill.

## Melee_wpn

This skill allows to attack with all **melee weapons**, real or dreamt.
It also allows for **maintenance** and **repair**
(might need materials or tools.)

## Thrown_wpn

This skill allows to attack with all **thrown weapons**
like stones, bolas, knives, grenades, real or dreamt.
It also allows for **maintenance** and **repair**
(might need materials or tools.)

## Unarmed_combat

This skill allows to **strike a foe** efficiently without any weapon.
It **does not increase damage** dealt without weapon,
it simply represents the character's ability
to hit properly without hurting themselves.

## Stealth

This skill allows to move around and handle loud objects
**without making any noise.**
Some detection systems (such as a directional microphone or a sonar)
could still detect the character, though.

This skill also allows to **hide**, **move unseen**, or **hide an object**
from someone.

## Balance

This skill allows to **keep one's balance** when the situation requires it.

## Riding

This skill allows to **ride any creature or toy** and keep it under control.
Any non-trivial action like jumping, combat, or galopping will require a
[Skill](Riding) roll.

This skill also allows for **knowledge** and **caring**
of common domestic animals

## Dodging

This skill allows to **avoid an attack** without diving to the ground,
and to be able to act the following turn.
A successful [Skill](Dodging) roll completely negates the incoming attack.

The die to roll depends on the attack attempted:

- A **melee attack** is dodged on a **D6**.
- A **thrown attack** is dodged on a **D8**.
- A **short-range ranged attack** is dodged on a **D10**.
- A **long-range ranged attack** is dodged on a **D8**.

## Climbing

This skill allows to **climb** with or without special gear.

## Handling

This skill allows to **activate**, **feel**, **handle**, and
**examine** objects and surfaces.

The character will have to make a [Skill](Handling) roll to:

- **Activate** an unknown mechanism
- **Find** a secret button
- **Juggle**
- Do a magic trick
- **Feel around** for a hidden door

## Aerial

This skill allows to efficiently control the power [Power](Flight),
for all the complex manoeuvres like taking off, landing, dodging in mid-air, etc.

## Acrobatics

This skill mostly allows to **limit fall damage**.

It also allows to perform extraordinary moves such as:

- a **cartwheel**
- **contortions**
- keeping a **flow** of movement

A character suffers 3 points of damage per multiple of their scale factor.
A successful [Skill](Acrobatics) roll will cancel 3 of those points.

## War_machine

This skill allows to attack with any and all
**automatic weapons** as well as **canons** or **rocket launchers**.
It also allows for their **repair** and **maintenance**
(might need materials or tools.)

### Fire modes

Every weapon used by this skill fires in 3 different modes:

- _Single Fire_
- _Bursts_
- _Full Auto_

A **full auto** attack focused on a single target deals **+10** damage.
It can also be spread to a **90Â° field**,
in which case the attack allows for up to **3 distincts damage rolls**
on 3 different targets.

A **burst** shot only boosts the damage by **+5**.

## KnockOut

This skill allows to **knock out a foe** for a duration of **1D6** rounds
if they fail a [Skill](Willpower) roll.

## Driving_land

This skill allows to **drive** any and all land vehicles,
real or dreamt.
It also allows for **maintenance**, but **not for repair**
(that much is handled on a case-by-case
basis, depending on the nature of the vehicle: Electronics,
Mechanics, etc.)

A character can drive a vehicle with a successful
[Skill](Driving_land)
roll, up to a scale difference allowed by the _Interactions_ table.
Beyond that, it'll be impossible because
the vehicle is too small, or a group effort because it is too big.

Driving an actual real-life car will require 5 toys at least.
