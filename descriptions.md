# Skill

## Ranged_wpn

This skill allows to use all kinds of **ranged weapons**, real or dreamt.
It also allows for **maintenance** and **repair**
(might need materials or tools.)

All ranged weapons follow the same **ammunitions management** rule:
on every shot attempt, the player must first
succeed an
**ammunition roll**
(detailed in each weapon's description) by rolling
for a lower total than the weapon's value.
This system bundles under a single roll
things like weapon fiability, ammunition reliability,
and the possibility to run out of ammo.
A failed roll means an empty magazine or a jammed weapon,
which could be re-engaged with a new
[Skill](Ranged_wpn)
roll and may need some tools.

---

Automatic weapons are handled with the [Skill](War_machine) skill.

## Melee_wpn

This skill allows to attack with all **melee weapons**, real or dreamt.
It also allows for **maintenance** and **repair**
(might need materials or tools.)

## Thrown_wpn

This skill allows to attack with all **thrown weapons**
like stones, bolas, knives, grenades, real or dreamt.
It also allows for **maintenance** and **repair**
(might need materials or tools.)

## Unarmed_combat

This skill allows to **strike a foe** efficiently without any weapon.
It **does not increase damage** dealt without weapon,
it simply represents the character's ability
to hit properly without hurting themselves.

## Stealth

This skill allows to move around and handle loud objects
**without making any noise.**
Some detection systems (such as a directional microphone or a sonar)
could still detect the character, though.

This skill also allows to **hide**, **move unseen**, or **hide an object**
from someone.

## Balance

This skill allows to **keep one's balance** when the situation requires it.

## Riding

This skill allows to **ride any creature or toy** and keep it under control.
Any non-trivial action like jumping, combat, or galopping will require a
[Skill](Riding) roll.

This skill also allows for **knowledge** and **caring**
of common domestic animals

## Dodging

This skill allows to **avoid an attack** without diving to the ground,
and to be able to act the following turn.
A successful [Skill](Dodging) roll completely negates the incoming attack.

The die to roll depends on the attack attempted:

- A **melee attack** is dodged on a **D6**.
- A **thrown attack** is dodged on a **D8**.
- A **short-range ranged attack** is dodged on a **D10**.
- A **long-range ranged attack** is dodged on a **D8**.

## Climbing

This skill allows to **climb** with or without special gear.

## Handling

This skill allows to **activate**, **feel**, **handle**, and
**examine** objects and surfaces.

The character will have to make a [Skill](Handling) roll to:

- **Activate** an unknown mechanism
- **Find** a secret button
- **Juggle**
- Do a magic trick
- **Feel around** for a hidden door

## Aerial

This skill allows to efficiently control the power [Power](Flight),
for all the complex manoeuvres like taking off, landing, dodging in mid-air, etc.

## Acrobatics

This skill mostly allows to **limit fall damage**.

It also allows to perform extraordinary moves such as:

- a **cartwheel**
- **contortions**
- keeping a **flow** of movement

A character suffers 3 points of damage per multiple of their scale factor.
A successful [Skill](Acrobatics) roll will cancel 3 of those points.

## War_machine

This skill allows to attack with any and all
**automatic weapons** as well as **canons** or **rocket launchers**.
It also allows for their **repair** and **maintenance**
(might need materials or tools.)

### Fire modes

Every weapon used by this skill fires in 3 different modes:

- _Single Fire_
- _Bursts_
- _Full Auto_

A **full auto** attack focused on a single target deals **+10** damage.
It can also be spread to a **90Â° field**,
in which case the attack allows for up to **3 distincts damage rolls**
on 3 different targets.

A **burst** shot only boosts the damage by **+5**.

## KnockOut

This skill allows to **knock out a foe** for a duration of **1D6** rounds
if they fail a [Skill](Willpower) roll.

## Driving_land

This skill allows to **drive** any and all land vehicles,
real or dreamt.
It also allows for **maintenance**, but **not for repair**
(that much is handled on a case-by-case
basis, depending on the nature of the vehicle: [Skill](Mechanics),
[Skill](Electronics), etc.)

A character can drive a vehicle with a successful
[Skill](Driving_land)
roll, up to a scale difference allowed by the _Interactions_ table.
Beyond that, it'll be impossible because
the vehicle is too small, or a group effort because it is too big.

---

Driving an actual real-life car will require 5 toys at least.

## Counterfeit

This skill allows to **recognize** and **falsify** objects or documents.

A [Skill](Counterfeit) roll specifically will help
**determine particular details** to imitate
(signature, handwriting, formalisms, etc),
but it's the following actual fabricating roll (often [Skill](Handling))
that will determine the craftsmanship and quality.

## Explosives

This skill allows to use **demolition explosives** or **fireworks**
without risking an injury.

---

To _make_ explosives, you need to apply your knowledge of [Skill](Chemistry)

## Swimming

This skill allows **non-metallic** toys and animals to **float** and **swim**.

Even though they can't drown in real life, when in dreams toys _can faint_.
For animals, of course, they can drown in real life.

---

Swimming AP cost table:

- **Normal** pace: **1AP** for **10 minutes**
- **Fast** pace: **1AP** for **1 minutes**

Under normal circumstances, while the character has more than 10 AP,
no roll is necessary and the character can swim without any issue.
Under 10 AP, the character can only float.

Outside of normal circumstances, rolls will be done against this skill:
fast currents, carrying someone else, big waves, etc.

## Parrying

This skill allows to **use reactions** to parry enemy attacks.

## Pocketpicking

This skill allows to **snatch** things from someone's personage,
without them realizing it.

---

A single successful roll allows to either

- Learn what's in their pockets
- Snatch something at random

To recover a specific object, one must roll twice: once to ascertain
the contents of the pockets, another time to snatch the desired item.

On roll failure, the target becomes immediately aware of the attempt.

## Piloting_air

This skill allows to **pilot** any aerial vehicle: plane, glider, chopper...
real or dreamt.
It also allows for **maintenance**, but **not for repair**
(that much is handled on a case-by-case
basis, depending on the nature of the vehicle: [Skill](Mechanics),
[Skill](Electronics), etc.)

A character can pilot a vehicle with a successful
[Skill](Piloting_air)
roll, up to a scale difference allowed by the _Interactions_ table.
Beyond that, it'll be impossible because
the vehicle is too small, or a group effort because it is too big.

---

Driving an actual real-life plane will require 6 toys at least.

## Piloting_sea

This skill allows to **pilot** any marine vehicle:
jetski, sailboat, submarine... real or dreamt.
It also allows for **maintenance**, but **not for repair**
(that much is handled on a case-by-case
basis, depending on the nature of the vehicle: [Skill](Mechanics),
[Skill](Electronics), etc.)

A character can pilot a vehicle with a successful
[Skill](Piloting_sea)
roll, up to a scale difference allowed by the _Interactions_ table.
Beyond that, it'll be impossible because
the vehicle is too small, or a group effort because it is too big.

---

Driving an actual real-life small sailboat will require 10 toys at least.

## Repair

This skill allows to **repair** broken or torn toys,
and void any effect suffered from a 10+AP injury.

Repairing **takes time** and often requires **tools and materials**.

It is necessary to successfully roll on a difficulty depending on the
state of the toy to be repaired (see mending table below)

Beyond a cleaning or washing, repair will leave a mark: broken pieces replaced
with different colored pieces, glue/solder marks, etc. Unless the character
boosts the difficulty by 1.

### Mending table

- **Stained** : 1D6, 10min
- **Bent** : 1D8, 10min
- **Dirty** : 1D10, 30min
- **Torn** : 1D12, 1h
- **Broken** : 1D20, 5h
